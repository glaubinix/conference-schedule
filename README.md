To use this app for your own conference you need to change the following points:

* Create your own favicon and apple-touch-icon
* Adjust the css to your liking (or simply use a theme)
* Create a schedule.json with the conference schedule

### TODO
* Make example look pretty
* Add more default themes (js, ...)
* Load schedule from google spreadsheets or other sources
* Make the app actually work with local storage

### Features
* Load a schedule via json
* Current date tab will be preselected (if not applicable the first day will be selected)

### How Can I Contribute?
Fork and Pull Request, what else?
This project should stay as simple as possible. We would like to avoid having any dependencies likes jQuery or similar.
Though feel free to add some eye candy, like themes or other improvements.

### Special thanks to ...
This project is highly inspired by the jsconf.eu 2013 offline schedule app by @philnash!
