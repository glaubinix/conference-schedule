## Conference Schedule

### Usage
To use this app for your own conference you need to change the following points:

* Create your own favicon and apple-touch-icon
* Adjust the css to your liking (or simply use a theme)
* Create a schedule.json with the conference schedule
* If you add custom css / js file, make sure to add them to the conference.appcache file for offline mode

### Features
* Load a schedule via json
* Current date tab will be preselected (if not applicable the first day will be selected)
* Offline available using local storage and app cache

### How Can I Contribute?
Fork and Pull Request, what else?
This project should stay as simple as possible. We would like to avoid having any dependencies likes jQuery or similar.
Though feel free to add some eye candy, like themes or other improvements.

### Special thanks to ...
This project is highly inspired by the jsconf.eu 2013 offline schedule app by @philnash!
