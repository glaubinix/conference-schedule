## Roadmap
Just because I need a place to dump my ideas

### v0.2 
* Remove custom code with npm packages #phaseOne
* Introduce browserify
* Introduce build step

### v0.3
* Remove custom code with npm packages #phaseT  wo

### v0.4
* Introduce templating and avoid html strings (Preparation for plugin system)

### v0.5
* Plugin system not necessary support for all existing plugins
* Reintroduce tests for custom code (Preference on tap)

### v1.00
* Plugin system full support for current plugins
* Extract plugins into modules
* Move project to org

### Future (no specific order)
* iOS like Menu support (Button on the top, menu slides in from the left)
* Filters/Search
* Location Maps probably GoogleMaps integration for the location(s)
* Venue maps: not really sure what is possible but for some conferences this would be really helpful
* ConfS as a Service
* Allow multiple events in one App and allow certain events to be hidden (for instance for something like jsfest)
